# Clustering Experiment
A minimal demo to see if clustering is going to work

## Sample used
Several screen shots from wikipedia pages. I was about to run several samples, but my laptop was too slow so I only did one.

## How does it work
Simple do a k mean clustering on the image I cropped from wikipedia and see what happens.

## Tool used
Basically just tensorflow, numpy and scipy.

## Conclusion
I personally think this is mostly useless (completely different from what I thought it would be). Reguardless, I will put it here just in case that other people on the team find something valuable.
